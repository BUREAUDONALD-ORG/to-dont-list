# To Don't List

![](https://travis-ci.org/BUREAUDONALD-ORG/to-dont-list.svg?branch=master)

Site for the To Don't List book.

## Technical

This site is build using GatsbyJS.

For building the project [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org) is required.

The project dependencies themselves can then be installed with the command:

```npm install```

To run a local development server at localhost:8000
```npm run dev```

To deploy (given the right security clearance):
```npm run deploy```

Note that project is also deployed by Travis-CI on commit to the master branch.
This will only happen if the build doesn't generate errors.
