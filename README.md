# To Don't Company

Site for the [To Don't Company](http://todontlist.net) by [BureauDonald](https://www.bureaudonald.com).

## Technical

This site is build using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) v1.9 (version two is still in beta at the time of buiding and gave an error). To build the project [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org) is required.

The project dependencies themselves can then be installed with the command:

`npm install`

To run a local development server at localhost:8000

`npm run dev`

The site is moved to Netlify, for better continuous integration, more possibilities and less maintenance.

## Content

Most content is separated into different files, mostly in the pages directory. Editing these files will update the content in the site. The syntax in the file is [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) with [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) frontmatter.
