            Donald Roos is a creative entrepreneur based in Amsterdam (the
            Netherlands). Trained as a (typo)graphic designer, he sets up and
            runs projects with other professionals from different fields. Like
            many creatives, he has too much to do, and too many ideas — which is
            why he came up with the ToDon’tList-Method. This is Donald’s 3rd
            book together with co-writer Anne de Bruijn. They previously
            published Don’t Read This Book and Don’t Buy This Book.
