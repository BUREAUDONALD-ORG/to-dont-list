# Work Don’t Shop

## Productivity Workshop<br/>for Creative People

#### Workshop

The workshop revolves around your work process: how to make it more effective by making choices, how to make those choices (fast and good) and how to manage your time and ideas better. Donald’s motto is ‘Visualize your ideas, then we can talk about it’ and in the workshop, he will bring that into practice.

You’ll write, talk and sketch according to the To Don’tList method. You will work alone and in teams. The duration of the workshop can be anything from 30 minutes to 3 weeks. Bring your pencils and a bunch of sketch paper.

#### For whom?

The workshop can be tailored to different groups, from corporate organizations to art students. For instance, art students could learn to organize the way of they work and executives could get a much-needed creative impulse while viewing their own methods from a different perspective.

#### Costs

In the interest of saving everyone time: please don’t send an invitation for budgets under €1000, - (excluding travel expenses). Donald is based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
