A process that takes you from idea to final product can take 3 weeks, but could as well take 3 months, 3 days, or 3 years. You could even go through the process in 3 minutes: you sketch a few options, pick one, and ‘finalize’ it as much as you can in the short time you have left. The end result of such a 3-minute round could be a clear sketch or small mock-up, for instance.

Use the ToDon’tTimer to sketch and test your ideas in a limited timeframe. Decide to add the idea to your ToDon’tList or to spend a bigger timeframe on it.

You can use the ToDon’tTimer for all your creative processes. The ToDon’tTimer is also an interesting addition to Don’t/Do This – Game.
