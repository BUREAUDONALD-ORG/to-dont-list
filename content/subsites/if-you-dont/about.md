# Donald Roos

Donald Roos is a creative entrepreneur based in Amsterdam (the Netherlands). Trained as a (typo)graphic designer, he sets up and runs projects with other professionals from different fields.
Like many creatives, he has too much to do, and too many ideas — which is why he came up with the ToDon’tList-Method.

This is Donald’s 3rd book together with co-writer Anne de Bruijn. They previously published Don’t Read This Book and Don’t Buy This Book.
