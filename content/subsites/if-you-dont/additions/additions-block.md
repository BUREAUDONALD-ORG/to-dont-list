## Nobody is Perfect

Nobody is perfect, and although I tried to do research as well as possible and mentioned all the resources, but I might have missed some. Or you think some information is not correct (anymore). Please let me know if you find anything that need additional or corrected information in your opinion. We will take a serious look at your suggestion for an addition or correction. If needed it will publish here on this page. And in a next print, it will addedd (or removed) it to the book.
